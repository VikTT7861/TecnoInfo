      <h1>Monopole antenna (one pole) </h1>
      <br>
      <p> The Monopole antenna or Marconi antenna is the simplest antenna.
        It can be found and used in almost all radio services and
        telecommunications, especially in low frequencies. Installs in
        a vertical pole-like direction and grounded through the antenna mesh coupling.</p>

      <br><br>
      <p>Its operation is based on the virtual reflection generated by the ground in the opposite direction to the direction of the antenna. </p>
      <p> It uses a theory called the "mirror method". The reflection of the energy depends more or less on the physical characteristics of the earth, especially the conductivity. </p>
      <p> A monopole antenna presents an omnidirectional radiation pattern (in all directions) in a plane perpendicular to the antenna (generally horizontal). </p>
      <p> Although monopoles can be used in almost all technologies or all radio services, due to their size, they are actually the only monopoles dedicated to AM transmitters. </p>
      <p> If you look at it, AM transmitters are usually very long towers, sometimes even hundreds of meters, and other times installed as towers. </p>
      <p> They can also be used for other types of services, such as low-power FM broadcasting systems, mobile radio systems, low-coverage television systems, mobile phones, and Wi-Fi systems in rural areas. </p>
      <p> In the IIE teacher's laboratory, the antenna impedance was measured and a value of 50Ω was found for a frequency of 560 MH. </p>

      <center>
        <p>Dipoles are usually present in almost all currently existing services, mainly in the set of antennas of FM radio transmitters, but also in television transmitters and dispatch services, situations
          police and emergency, fire and ambulance, etc.

        <p>It is an antenna with two poles oriented in opposite directions, because each pole behaves like a part of a quarter wave transmission line. Therefore, the most common length is ½ wave. As the name suggests,
          is
          antenna is used for a single frequency. A good compromise between directionality and size is achieved. Depending on the service requirements, the antenna can be positioned horizontally or vertically with respect to the earth's surface. The
          Pattern
          Radiation is omni-directional in the H plane and is used for applications such as mobile communications.

      <h1>Yagi antenna - Uda</h1>
      <br>
      <center>
        <p> It is a directional antenna composed of parasitic elements and active elements, placed in parallel with each other, and supported by a moving arm or axis.
        </p>
        <img src="css/imgs/Antena Yagi – Uda.png" width="500" height="500" alt="">
        <br><br>
        <p> The parasitic element can be a reflector or director that defines the maximum radiation direction,
          while the active element is a ½ wave dipole. The simplest Yagi antenna consists of 3 elements.
          For the VHF and UHF bands, this type of antenna uses 30 There is a reflector and several directors between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to its simplicity and relatively large bandwidth, Yagi-Uda antennas
          are widely used in broadcast television applications, amateur radio stations
          and they have been used in other types of services in recent years, such as point radio links.
          Some yagis with frequencies above 1.5 GHz require the use of covers to protect against rainwater.

        <p> Currently, the use of invisible antennas occurs in the signals of mobile stations that try to
          reach different places. Telephone operators are trying to innovate in the quality of coverage
          to convince users of your plans. They are called invisible because they cannot be seen at this time.

        <p> The miniature size determines the application range of this antenna,

          In this way, the microstrip antenna or the patch antenna can simulate the emission from one point to another,
          but the structure is compact.
          The problem is that due to its microstructure, its gain is very low and it can fail due to external factors such as bad weather.

          Panel antennas usually work within the internet coverage area,

        <p> Directivity and gain are the low to medium quality elements in slot antennas.
          Their advantage is that they are as easy to manufacture and inexpensive as dipole antennas.
          Slot antennas allow propagation in a narrow place consisting of a plate
          metal to which waves are radiated.

      <h1>Acess Point</h1>
      <br>
      <p>A wireless access point allows devices that do not have a built-in Wi-Fi connection to access a wireless network with the help of an Ethernet cable</p>
      <p>An access point acts as a central transmitter and receiver for wireless radio signals. The main wireless access points support Wi-Fi and are used in homes. The access point can be incorporated into the router
        wired or standalone router</p>
      <p>There are differences between a wireless access point and a wireless router, one of them and the biggest difference is that the wireless router is that it creates a local area network connecting and managing all the devices.
        connected to it; whereas a wireless access point creates a local area network that only provides access to the established network of the router. Simply put, a router can change network settings, but a
        access point no</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What is your function</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Its function is simple, a wireless access point is designed so that it can provide wireless internet connection to devices that require it, such as tablets, smartphones, computers, etc. The points of
        access are more frequently used in medium and large companies and organizations, since several access points are usually installed to provide complete Wi-Fi coverage, allowing Wi-Fi networks to reach greater distances
        and number of clients</p>

      <h3>What are outdoor surveillance cameras</h3>
      <br>
      <p>They are devices designed for the security of any premises or home. They are preferred by families due to their functionality to detect any anomaly that occurs outside the homes, even most of the cameras of

      <br>
      <h3>Qualities of outdoor surveillance cameras</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Outdoor surveillance cameras are designed to withstand inclement weather such as rain, snow or even a continuous excess of sun and can be used in outdoor spaces</p>
